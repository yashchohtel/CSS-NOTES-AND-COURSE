--------------------------------------------------------

QUE 2 :- Creators and Maintenance of CSS?
. Css was created by a group of indivisuals known as the world wide web consortium (W3C).
. Primary contributors include Hakon Wiem Lie and Bert Bos.
. Css standards and specifications are maintained by the W3C.
. A community of web developers, designers, and browser vendors also contribute to its evolution.
. Regular updates and new versions ensue css remais relevant and adaptable to changing web design needs.


--------------------------------------------------------

QUE 3 :- CSS Rule structure ?
. A css rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
. declaration are used to define the style properties for the selector elements.
. Each declaration consists of a property and a value.

selector {
    property: value;
}

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 32px;
}

here h1 is selector curly brackets are declaration block and color is property and red is value of the property.


--------------------------------------------------------

QUE 4 :- Three Ways to write css?
. Inline CSS -> Style applied directly to on html element using the style attribute.
<h1 style="color: blue;" >THIS IS HEADING</h1>.

. Internal CSs -> Styles defined within the <style> tag within the HTML document's <head>.
<style>
    h1 {
        color: white;
        font-size: 12px;
    }
</style>

. External CSS -> Styles stored in separate .css files linked to the html document using the <link> element. 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css file link">

What is css selectors?
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

----------------

[I. SIMPLE SELECTOR]

1. Universal selector -> The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

2. CSS element Selector -> The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
Example
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

3. CSS id Selector -> The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Example
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1":
Note: An id name cannot start with a number!

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}


4. CSS class Selector -> The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
different element can have same class selector and one element can have more than one class.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

p.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

Example
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": 

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>

----------------

[II. COMBINATORY SELECTORS]

1. Descendant Selector -> The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 

Example
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

2. Child Selector (>) -> The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:

Example
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) -> The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

Example
div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

4. General Sibling Selector (~) -> The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 

Example
div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

2. CSS [attribute="value"] Selector -> The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.

The following example selects all <a> elements with a target="_blank" attribute:

Example
a[target="_blank"] {
  background-color: yellow;
}

3. CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector -> The [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.

The following example selects all elements with a title attribute that contains a space-separated list of words, one of which is "flower":

Example
[title~="flower"] {
  border: 5px solid yellow;
}

The example above will match elements with title="flower", title="summer flower", and title="flower new", but not title="my-flower" or title="flowers".

4. CSS [attribute^="value"] Selector -> The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value starts with the specified value.

The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that starts with "top":

Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!

Example
[class^="top"] {
  background: yellow;
}

5. CSS [attribute|="value"] Selector -> The [attribute|="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value can be exactly the specified value, or the specified value followed by a hyphen (-).

Note: The value has to be a whole word, either alone, like class="top", or followed by a hyphen( - ), like class="top-text".

Example
[class|="top"] {
  background: yellow;
}

6. CSS [attribute$="value"] Selector -> The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.

The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that ends with "test":

Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!  

Example
[class$="test"] {
  background: yellow;
}

7. CSS [attribute*="value"] Selector -> The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.

The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that contains "te":

Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!  

Example
[class*="te"] {

--------------------------------------------------------

QUE 7 :- What is colors in css ?

colors are used to add colors on element. color is added by color property
ex - color: red;
in css colors can be specified using color name, rgb, rgba, hex code, hsl

1. color name => simple colors modern browsers suport 140 named colors.
ex- red, blue, etc.

2. rgb => rgb(red,green,blue). we have to give red green and blue its points betwwen 0 to 255. 

The rgb() function define colors using the Red-green-blue (RGB) model. An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue). Each parameter defines the intensity of that color and can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage value (from 0% to 100%).

rgb(0,0,0) => black
rgb(255,255,255) => white
rgb(255,0,0) => red
rgb(0,255,0) => green
rgb(0,0,255) => blue

3. rgba =>  rgba(red,green,blue,alpha)
alpha parameter is a number between 0-1, 0.0(fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
ex- rgba(255,255,255,0.7)

4.hex => #rrggbb rr(red), gg(green), bb(blue) hexadecimal value between 00 and ff (same as deficmal 0-255)
red:#ff0000;
red:#000000;
red:#ffffff;

5.hsl => hsl(hue,saturation,lightness)
ex- RED:hsl(0,100%,50%)

HUE is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
SATURARION is percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. 
LIGHTNESS is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark 100% is white.

6.hsla => hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
. alph parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent al all)
ex- ex- RED:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.5)

HUE - A pure color
TINT - A pure color with just white added
SHADE - A pure color with just black added
Tone - A pure color with just grey added

QUE 9 :- What is a CSS Unit?

A CSS unit determines the size of a property you're setting for an element or its content. For example, if you wanted to set the property margin of a paragraph, you would give it a specific value. This value includes the CSS unit. Let's look at a small example: p { margin: 20px; } 

here are two type of lenght units in css -> Absolute Lengths and Relative Lengths.

------------

Absolute lengths: The absolute length units are fixed and a length expresed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

absolute - centimeter(cm), mm(milimeter), inch(inch), px(pixel), pt(), pc(pikas)
cm - normaly centimeter
mm - normaly milimeter
in - normaly inch
px - 1px (1inch = 96px) average
pt - (1inch = 72pt) average
pc - (1inch = 12pc) average

1. Pixels (px) : px is an absolute unit in css, representing the smallest unit of screen space. It provides a fixed and consistence size on all devices and screens. 

------------

Relative Lengths: relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different medium.

relative - em(), rem(), vh(viewport height), vw(viewport width), %(percentage)
Em - em is relative to the size of its direct parent
Rem - rem is only relative to root (html tag) size
vh - 1% of view port height
Vw - 1% of view port width
% -  relative to parent


1. EM (em): em is a relative unit that is calculated based on the font size of the parent element. When you set an element's size in em it's relative to the font size of its nearest parent with a speified font size

2. REM (rem) :Rem (short for “root-em”) units dictate an element's font size relative to the size of the root element. By default, most browsers use a font size value of 16px. So, if the root element is 16px, an element with the value 1rem will also equal 16px.

--------------------------------------------------------

QUE 11 :- What is box model?
HEIGHT AND WIDTH -> Height and width are use to add Height and width of an element. we can add Height and width by Height and width property. we can add Height and width in px and percentage. if we add pixel it will take as per pixel and if in percentage it will take according to the parent container if 50% it will width 50% of the parent container.

Total element width = width + left-padding + right-padding + left-border + right-border + left-margin + right-margin
Total element height = height + top-padding + bottom-padding + top-border + bottom-border + top-margin + bottom-margin
