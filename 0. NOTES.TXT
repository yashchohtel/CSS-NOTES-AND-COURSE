* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

3. CSS id Selector -> The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Note: An id name cannot start with a number!

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}


4. CSS class Selector -> The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
