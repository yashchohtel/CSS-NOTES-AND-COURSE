The position Property :- The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

The position property in css is used to control the positioning of elements withi a web page. It defines how an element should be placed relative to its normal position in the document flow or relative to its parent or containing elements.



There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed

sticky

static -  position: static;
it is by default all element has static. it is a normal flow

relative - position: relative;
in position relative box move around according to its actual place and it does not leave its space.

absolute - position: absolute;
it take position according to its position parent (the parent is positioned, when its parent has position property other than static ) and it leaves it place if it is position relative and another element takes its place.

fixed - position: fixed;
it react according to viewport it take left right top bottom property according to html. and it get fixed when it's left right id defined
Elements with position: fixed; are positioned relaive tothe viewpot , so they remain in the same position even when the page is scrolld, you can use top. right, bottom, and left properties to specify the exact positon.

sticky - position: sticky;
it will move but if specified top or left value it will stick to that position and dont move after that
