A CSS unit determines the size of a property you're setting for an element or its content. For example, if you wanted to set the property margin of a paragraph, you would give it a specific value. This value includes the CSS unit. Let's look at a small example: p { margin: 20px; } 

There are two type of lenght units in css -> Absolute Lengths and Relative Lengths.

------------

Absolute lengths: The absolute length units are fixed and a length expresed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

absolute - centimeter(cm), mm(milimeter), inch(inch), px(pixel), pt(), pc(pikas)
cm - normaly centimeter
mm - normaly milimeter
in - normaly inch
px - 1px (1inch = 96px) average
pt - (1inch = 72pt) average
pc - (1inch = 12pc) average

1. Pixels (px) : px is an absolute unit in css, representing the smallest unit of screen space. It provides a fixed and consistence size on all devices and screens. 

------------

Relative Lengths: relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different medium.

relative - em(), rem(), vh(viewport height), vw(viewport width), %(percentage)
Em - em is relative to the size of its direct parent
Rem - rem is only relative to root (html tag) size
vh - 1% of view port height
Vw - 1% of view port width
% -  relative to parent


1. EM (em): em is a relative unit that is calculated based on the font size of the parent element. When you set an element's size in em it's relative to the font size of its nearest parent with a speified font size

2. REM (rem) :Rem (short for “root-em”) units dictate an element's font size relative to the size of the root element. By default, most browsers use a font size value of 16px. So, if the root element is 16px, an element with the value 1rem will also equal 16px.
